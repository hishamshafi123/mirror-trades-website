      {
        "question": "What is Copy Trading?",
        "answer": "Copy Trading is an investment technique that allows investors to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders in real time. When a professional trader opens, closes, or modifies a position, the same actions are automatically executed in your account. This way, you can benefit from the experience and strategy of skilled traders without needing trading knowledge yourself or monitoring the markets daily."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay anything for Mirror Trades?",
        "answer": "No, using Mirror Trades is 100% free for you. There are no hidden fees or subscriptions for our service. The only cost is the capital you deposit with your broker to fund your trading account, and any charges from the broker itself (e.g., spread, transaction commissions), which apply as they normally would to any account."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the minimum deposit to get started?",
        "answer": "The minimum recommended initial deposit is $200 (around €180). For better results and more risk flexibility, many of our investors start with $500+."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Copy Trading high risk?",
        "answer": "The risk depends on you – you decide how much capital to copy and with what risk settings. You can choose very low exposure at the beginning. In any case, trading CFDs carries risk and there is a possibility of capital loss. We recommend starting conservatively: with the lowest possible risk, and after observing results for a few weeks, adjusting as you feel comfortable. Always invest amounts you can afford to lose and stay informed about the risks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of returns can I expect?",
        "answer": "There are no guaranteed or fixed returns; they depend on market conditions and the strategy of the trader you follow. However, you will see the performance history of the strategies inside the company's MyFxBook at any time, with statistics such as profit percentage, maximum drawdown, win rate, etc. This helps you set realistic expectations. Remember: past performance does not guarantee future results, but we work with the goal of consistent profits and minimizing losses."
      },
      {
        "question": "How exactly are the trades executed?",
        "answer": "Once you connect your account and choose which trader to copy, all orders from that trader are automatically copied into your account in real time. This means that when the trader opens, closes, or modifies a position (e.g., stop-loss, take-profit), the same action happens in your account. It's a fully automated process – you don't need to do anything manually during the day. Of course, you always have the option to intervene if you wish (e.g., close a position earlier)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I adjust my risk?",
        "answer": "Yes, you have full control. You can set the trade size you copy relative to the trader (e.g., 1:1 or a smaller percentage). You can also set loss limits (e.g., maximum daily drawdown) through the platform's tools. At any moment, you can pause or completely stop copying with a single click. This flexibility allows you to tailor Copy Trading to your own needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are my personal details and money safe?",
        "answer": "Yes. Your personal data is fully protected, and the platforms of our partner brokers (Vantage, Multibank) use encryption and strict security protocols for your information. In addition, these brokers operate under regulatory frameworks, which means they provide client fund protection (e.g., segregated accounts, and possibly even client fund insurance coverage). Regarding your money: it remains in your own broker account. Mirror Trades has no access to or rights over your funds – you alone manage them."
      },
      {
        "question": "How am I supported as a client?",
        "answer": "We offer personalized support. You will have direct communication with us via Telegram for any issue, from technical assistance to trading questions. Additionally, the brokers themselves (Vantage, Multibank) have support teams you can use for platform or account matters. On top of that, you'll have a dedicated account manager from Mirror Trades who will help you with anything you need throughout our collaboration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I stop copying the trader whenever I want?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. There are no time commitments. At any moment, you can click \"Stop\" in the app to stop copying a trader. You can even disconnect your account completely from the copy trading system if you wish. There are no penalties or fees for doing this. This flexibility is a key part of our service – you're in control at all times."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need trading experience to do this?",
        "answer": "Not at all. Copy Trading is designed specifically for people who have no experience or time for active trading. You don't need to know technical analysis, nor do you need to monitor the markets daily. Professional traders do the work, while you simply decide whom to follow and set your parameters. Of course, it always helps to understand basic concepts (and that's why we provide educational material), but no prior experience is required."
